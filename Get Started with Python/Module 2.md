Function - lets you perform specific tasks/actions on your data eg. print(), type()

`def function_name(parameters)`
- Parameters are the arguments that you pass to the function

`return` - get results back from a fx -> results are saved for later use
- Allows for reusability

Can use comments `#` to breakdown thought process/show steps for fx
Docstring `'''` used to summarise fx and its arguments/parameters and outputs

Boolean - value that is True or False
- Get Booleans whenever you compare things (comparators)
- Used to control logical flow

Python comparators: >, >=, <, <=, == , !=
- Can't always be used between diff data types

Logical operators: connect multiple statements together
- AND OR NOT

Conditional statements: if/else/elif -> create branches; different execution scripts based on certain conditions ie. to make decisions

`if` - execute code *if* the statement is true or conditions are met

`elif` - else if... used to check another condition

`else` - executes when everything else is False
