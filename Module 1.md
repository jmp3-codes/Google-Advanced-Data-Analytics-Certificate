Transistors - have 2 states on/off -> control flow of electricity
By chaining together millions of these - you can create complex logic
So computers are just billions of transistors - only understand things in binary

`==` used to check for equivalency

Object oriented programming
- based around objects - contain both data and code that manipulates the data
- object - instance of a class
- class - an object's data type; bundles data and functionality
	- Built in functionality includes method and attributes
- Method is a function that belongs to a class "actions or operations"
	- built into the type itself. 
	- Call method using dot notation
- Attribute - a value associated with an object or class "characteristics"
	- accessed using dot notation
	- allow you to access characteristics of a class, but they don't change it
	- Stored in _ _init_ _

Core python classes: Integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, frozensets, functions, ranges, and none

Variables - point to values. Can store values of any data type
Before assigning, think about:
1. Name
2. Data type
3. Starting value

Assignment - process of storing a value in variable
Variables have dynamic data type in python - can be reassigned to different type

Variable naming restrictions
- can only include letters, numbers, or underscores
- must start with letter or underscore
- **case sensitive**
- cannot include brackets

Naming conventions: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

String - textual info. Can be instantiated with single or double quotes. Immutable data type
Integer - whole number
Float - decimal

`type()` checks data type of object

Implicit conversion - python automatically converts one data type to another
eg. adding int and float 

Explicit conversion - user changes data type ie. type casting
